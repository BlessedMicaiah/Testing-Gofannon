## How to do Introductions
## Resolution
- Go to [Introductions](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/gofannon/discussions/categories/introductions)
- Click **New Discussion**
- Title the post with your name and write the introduction in the body.

- ## Suggested Improvement  
- Add a section in the **Contributing Guide** or **README** explaining how and where to introduce oneself.  
- Include a template for introductions to make it easier for newcomers.

### Friction Logs for README Update

## 1> Initial Uncertainty: Scope of Changes

- **Friction**: The issue mentioned updating the README to "more accurately reflect the evolving mission," but it wasn't immediately clear what aspects needed to be modified beyond what was listed.
- **Resolution**: Clarified by referring to the issue description, which specified adding the mission statement, updating the image URL, and including build badges and a basic usage example.

## 2> Confusion Over "High-Level" Content

- **Friction**: The maintainer mentioned that the "high-level" description could be copy-pasted. The meaning of "high-level" wasn't initially clear.
- **Resolution**: Understood that "high-level" referred to the overview of the projectâ€™s mission and purpose, rather than detailed technical documentation.

## 3>  Handling Relative vs. Absolute Links
- **Friction**: The README originally contained a relative link to the logo image, which needed to be replaced with an absolute link.
- **Resolution**: Updated the logo reference to https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/gofannon/blob/main/gofannon.jpg as per the maintainer's request.
